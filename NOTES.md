## What is arbitrage
 - `Arbitrage` - the simultaneous buying and selling of securities, currency, or commodities in different markets or in derivative forms in order to take advantage of differing prices for the same asset.

 **Dex** 
 - `slippage` Is basically a protection for user when submitting a swap/trade transaction to only execute the trade in a range of specified amount of token to sell (ex: sell 100 ETH => for atleast 1000_000 USDC) if it goes outside of the range, revert the transaction.
    - bcoz theres a certain delay on each transaction depends on the gas fee being sent by user, if the user sent less fee then their tx most likely will takes longer from being executed, and during that delay the token price could change (up/down)

     - ex: BTC current price $30K
     - ex: and mercy believed that bitcoin will surpassed $30K in the coming months, and John believed that bitcoin prices will be drop below $30k
     - that means, mercy should pay $30K for buying 1 BTC whatever the BTC prices will be in that whole months before the expiration date of the contract. (ex: contract expiration for 1 month)
     - if in a month the BTC prices go up (ex: $38K) mercy still can buy at the $30K price and that means Mercy makes profit from it
     - if the prices of BTC going down in a month ($20K), that means Mercy loses $10K and John makes profit $10K from it.
 - Derivatives - pretty much the same like `Futures`, but they dont have expiration date on the     contract.
